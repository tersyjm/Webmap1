# Webmap1
Project name: Webmap1
This map provides a route from the Belk Library on Appalachian State University's campus to Espresso News. 
There are three websites that were used to collect and analyze the data. 
https://www.google.com/maps
http://geojson.io/#map=2/20.0/0.0
https://mapstogpx.com/
A web template was used to help guide me through making my first web map. Google maps was used to create a route from the Belk Library to Espresso News. Maps to GPX to convert the google directions into a gpx file. Finally GeoJSON was convert the gpx file to GeoJSON which is needed for mapping. An HTML document was used to create the link and edit the features of the website. The HTML document was opened in Atom to make these changes. The map was styled and edited by Atom in the index.html file. User interaction was also added so the map reader can click on important locations and the name of the place marked will show up.
